0.7

* Switched to using an internal vector type that unboxes as much as it can. This lets type inference work much better when playing around at the ghci REPL.

0.6
---
* Version bumped to exceed the # of Hans Hoglund's `sparse` package. He started and released his library during the creation of this library, but graciously offered to let me take over the name. His library is now on hackage as `sparser`.
